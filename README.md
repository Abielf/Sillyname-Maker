This application was made for a few reasons. One was that it's been too long since my last github commit, and I need to get back to regularly putting new projects or changes to old projects on here.

The second is that I wanted to track my progress using my laptop as a development platform. We can code react apps again! Node.js works! Hooray!

The third, and maybe most important, is that this is a silly idea I had with a friend, rife with in-jokes. And what are we without friendship?
